dotfiles

Making my command line a welcome place

Installation
------------

Run install.sh to copy the files over to your home directory.  *WARNING:* this WILL overwrite any existing .profile you have installed, so make sure to back up first.  If you installed via this script, it will copy over any existing files in your ~/dotfiles directory.

For machine-specific configuration you don't want to add to the project, place a file in ~/dotfiles/.thismachine which will be read if it exists.

I tried to credit people I borrowed code from where applicable.
